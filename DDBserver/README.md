# Kitchen Guard Server side

## Django Framework 
Django is a Python web framework known for its rapid development and clean design principles. With Django, developers can build web applications quickly, thanks to its "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) philosophy. It includes features like an intuitive ORM for database management, a built-in admin interface, and powerful URL routing. Django's template engine simplifies dynamic HTML generation, while its form handling capabilities streamline data validation and processing. Security is paramount, with built-in protections against common web threats. Django is scalable, with support for caching, sharding, and load balancing, and benefits from a robust community and ecosystem of extensions. 

## Directory structure
The directory structure is mainly based on how Django structures its directories. The directory consists of "DDBserver" which is the project directory, "frontend" which handles the frontend template files, and "KitchenGuardServer" which is responsible for handling the database.
